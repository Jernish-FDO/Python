# Python Learning Journey: Basics to Advanced in 90 Days

Welcome to the **90-Day Python Mastery Roadmap**. This repository is designed to guide you through the process of learning Python from absolute scratch to advanced professional levels.

## 🚀 The 90-Day Roadmap

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Days 1-30)
Focus: Building a strong core understanding of syntax and logic.
- **Weeks 1-2**: Environment setup, Variables, Data Types, Control Flow (`if/else`, `loops`), and Functions.
- **Weeks 3-4**: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries), List Comprehensions, and File I/O.

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts (Days 31-60)
Focus: Moving beyond basic scripts to structured programming.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation. Modules and Packages.
- **Weeks 7-8**: Advanced Functions (Lambdas, Map/Filter), Decorators, Generators, and NumPy/Pandas intro.

### Phase 3: Advanced & Mastery (Days 61-90)
Focus: Deep architectural knowledge and specialized tracks.
- **Weeks 9-10**: 
    - **Advanced Architecture**: Metaclasses, Context Managers, Concurrency (`threading`, `multiprocessing`, `asyncio`), Memory Management.
    - **Testing & Tooling**: `pytest`, CI/CD pipelines, Dockerizing Python apps.
- **Weeks 11-12**: **Choose a Track**
    - **Web Track**: Fullstack with Django/FastAPI + React.
    - **Data Track**: Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch).
    - **DevOps Track**: Scripting for Infrastructure, Security/Pen-testing with Python.

## 💡 Explain Like I'm Five (ELI5)

**What is Python?**
Imagine Python is like a very smart, friendly robot that understands simple instructions. Instead of talking to it in complicated computer code (0s and 1s), you talk to it in something that looks almost like English. You can tell it to "Print this message," "Add these numbers," or "Go find information on the web," and it does it!

**Why learn it in 90 days?**
Think of it like learning to play a complex board game. 
- **First 30 days:** You learn the rules and how the pieces move.
- **Next 30 days:** You learn the strategies to win.
- **Last 30 days:** You start playing in big tournaments and making up your own versions of the game.
