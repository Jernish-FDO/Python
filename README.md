# Python Learning Journey: Basics to Advanced in 90 Days

Welcome to the **90-Day Python Mastery Roadmap**. This repository is designed to guide you through the process of learning Python from absolute scratch to advanced professional levels.

## 🚀 The 90-Day Roadmap

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Days 1-30)
Focus: Building a strong core understanding of syntax and logic.
- **Weeks 1-2**: Environment setup, Variables, Data Types, Control Flow (`if/else`, `loops`), and Functions.
- **Weeks 3-4**: Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries), List Comprehensions, and File I/O.

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts (Days 31-60)
Focus: Moving beyond basic scripts to structured programming.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation. Modules and Packages.
- **Weeks 7-8**: Advanced Functions (Lambdas, Map/Filter), Decorators, Generators, and NumPy/Pandas intro.

### Phase 3: Advanced & Specialization (Days 61-90)
Focus: Building real-world applications and mastering advanced patterns.
- **Weeks 9-10**: Web Development (Flask/FastAPI), REST APIs, and SQL/Databases.
- **Weeks 11-12**: Deep Dive - Data Science, Automation, or Advanced Web Dev. Deployment and Testing.
